<p> My name is Kaelan Matthew and I am a student at <a href="https://wwwcreatecarribean.org/" target="_self"> Create and Code.</p> </a> <br/>

<p>I am a ten year year old with a mission to suceed in everything I do. I have a keen interest in technology and hope to become an ICT Professor. As a professor in ICT I will help others to understand the art of Information Communication Technology and to apply these concepts accordingly. Currently, I attend the Saint Mary's Primary School. I enjoy the subjects of English and Math. In my spare time, I enjoy riding my bike and playing video games. I am also a green belt in Martial Arts.</p>

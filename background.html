    <h1>The History of Cell Phones</h1>
    
 <p>The concept of cellular phones has been around since the late 1940s. Yet, it wasn’t until the mid-1950s that technology was able to allow the idea to become a reality. It took a few decades to figure out how to make the technology work for ordinary routine calls. It was Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, who made the first cell phone call on April 4, 1973 to Dr. Joel S. Engel at Bell Labs. It would be another decade still before the technology was made available to consumers. The world of communication has not been the same since. Today we take a look at the timeline for cell phones and its history.</p>
 <br>
 
 <p>1983: The first analog cellular system is called 1G (1st Generation). Quickly, several companies sprout up and build an analog cellular network. What is an analog system? It’s a system designed to send sound signals of varying frequencies to transmit information.</p><br>
 
 <p>MID 1990s: Digital 2G quickly displaces analog 1G networks. Instead of using varying sound frequencies, this new digital system translates everything into a string of data points - Os and 1s. 2G makes it possible to transmit information significantly faster than the analog system, and is able to support photos, music, and texting (Short Message Service or “SMS”), while protecting our privacy more effectively.</p><br>
   
   <p>MID 2000s: The launch of 3G networks represents a turning point for the potential of what cellular data systems can support. Due to the vastly improved speeds and much stronger capacity to carry information, a phone might be able to do more than just talk and text.</p><br>
   
   <p>June 29, 2007: Apple introduces the iPhone and the smartphone as we know it is born. Apple takes advantage of the increased speed and capacity of 3G. Now, your phone actually becomes much more than a mechanism to talk and text.

The smartphone also changes the way we interact and command a phone by launching the touchscreen; we now tap and swipe. Additionally, Apple opens up a whole new world of possibilities with the advent of “apps” (custom designed applications and functions). The consolidation of our personal technology to one device begins.</p><br>

<p>Recent 2000s: 4G represents an even more pronounced development in terms of speed and volume of data for a cellular network. While carriers transition to 4G, devices are still not utilizing the full capacity a 4G network can provide. Think of it as trying to get a sip of water from Niagara Falls and you can see the problem.</p><br>

<p>Today: 5G is launched!</p>
